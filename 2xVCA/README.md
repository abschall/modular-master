# 2x VCA - Dual Voltage-Controlled Amplifier

<div align="justify">
  
2x VCA is a two-channel VCA based on Mutable Instruments' Veils, designed by Émilie Gillet. It features two separate voltage-controlled amplifiers, each with gain and response curve potentiometers, which are variable from linear to exponential. The PCB has been adapted to create a larger, more performance-friendly module for my purposes, providing more space between the jacks and knobs.

The module is 8HP wide and 21mm deep.

The PCB utilizes 0805 format surface-mount device (SMD) components.
