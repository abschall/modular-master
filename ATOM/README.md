ATOM is a three channel ATtenuverter and Offset Mixer. Each input is equipped with a dedicated bipolar control potentiometer for its input. When a cable is plugged into an input jack, the corresponding channel's potentiometer acts as an attenuverter.

In the absence of an input signal (no cable patched to an input), the input automatically normalizes to a 5V DC offset. The dedicated potentiometer then adjusts the offset voltage from -5V (fully counterclockwise) to +5V DC (fully clockwise), with a neutral 0V DC offset at the 12 o'clock position. Each channel combines inputs A and B, providing the summed output at the OUT jack. Should no cable be connected to a channel's OUT jack, its output is cascaded to the next channel, allowing ATOM to function as a versatile mixer with configurations of 2, 4, or even 6 channels, depending on how the outputs are utilized and connected.
The project is available in two formats: a smaller 6 HP version and a more performance-oriented 10HP version, catering to different preferences and potentially accommodating those with larger fingers.
