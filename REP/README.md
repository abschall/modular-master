# REP -  Audio Buffered Mults 

<img src="Misc/Panel Artwork/REP - Panel Rev3 - Artwork.png" width="50">
<div align="justify">
REP is a two channel 1-in-3 Audio Buffered Multiple (or Mults). Input signals applied to the input sockets (sockets marked and ) are replicated at the three output sockets directly below. Each output is buffered using NE5532 dual Operational Amplifiers for audio signal integrity. 
In scenarios where no input is connected to the second channel, the first channel is automatically normalled to the second channel. Consequently, the module functions as a 1-in-6 buffered multiple, effectively distributing the input signal across six outputs.
